Welcome
=======

I'm _Chuanxin Niu_ (牛传欣), call me _Minos_ if it's easier. 

You'll see _C. Minos Niu_ in all my publications. 

I've been enjoying my life and work since I joined [SangerLab](http://www.sangerlab.org) at [USC](http://www.usc.edu). Before that I did my PhD in Chicago. Keep tracing back you'll find me in [China](/info).

Research
========
I wonder how brains control movements ...

So I'm building a "brain" on __[chip](/work/)__.

And see if they make robots __[alive](/work#sick_robot)__.

If in this "brain" something goes __[wrong](/work/)__ ...

It tells me why robots/people/children get __[movement disorders](/work/)__.
