About Me
========

I grew up in China,

Why going by "Minos"?
==========
I take great pride in my Chinese given name *Chuanxin* (传欣, literally to spread out the prosperity), but decided to go by *Minos*. Chinese names with "x"
may sound spectacularly unpredictable when attempted in other languages. As much as I appreciate people's effort in saying my name correctly, it frequently "helped" me miss my flights, 
roll calls and even raffles. 

*Minos* was picked from a serendipity search in a giant English dictionary, which was seemingly the most knowledgable thing at my home before Google was available. People sometimes confuse [Minos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos) with [Minotaur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur), a mythological semi-taurus creature. In pure coincidence, my last name *Niu* happens to mean a taurus -- also my family totem. I enjoy such confusions and so far _Minos_ as a name works well.
