About Me
========

I grew up in China,

Why going by "Minos"?
==========
I take great proud of my Chinese given name *Chuanxin* but decided to go by *Minos*. Chinese names with "x"
may sound spectacularly unpredictable when attempted in other languages. As much as I appreciate people's effort in saying my name correctly, it frequently "helped" me miss my flights, 
roll call and even raffles. 

*Minos* was from a serendipity search in a dictionary. It happens to suggest a taurus, represented by my last name *Niu*. I love such coincidences and so far _Minos_ worked well.
